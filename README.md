# LIL is a Language

This is the main repository of the LIL language. I chose the MIT license.

The file lilspec.md contains the specification of the language. It's not a tutorial, but it's quite easy to read. Warning: WORK IN PROGRESS!!

In the cpp folder resides the compiler that is a custom front-end that interfaces with LLVM to generate native machine code. Warning: WORK IN PROGRESS!!

The lil_cli folder contains the command line interface to the compiler. Also written in C++. Warning: WORK IN PROGRESS!!
